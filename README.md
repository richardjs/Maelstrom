# Maelstrom

Maelstrom was originally a classic Mac OS game, first released as shareware in
1992 by Andrew Welch of Ambrosia Software. Ambrosia gave the source to Sam
Lantinga, who released Maelstrom 3.0, a SDL port under the GPL, in 1995. The
game assets were released under the CC Attribution license in 2010.

The latest version of the unmodified SDL port is available at
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/Maelstrom/.

*This repo is a fork off of the SDL port. There are two primary changes:*

1.	The code has been updated to compile on modern machines.

2.	The retro-thrusters powerup has been modified. Instead of being
	constantly active, and thus constantly slowing your ship, they are
	bound to a key, and only activate when that key is pressed.

  Maelstrom 3.0 is a GPL'd port of the original shareware game for the
  Macintosh.  It is a fast-action, high resolution (640x480) asteroids-like

  The GPL version of Maelstrom is not supported by Ambrosia Software,
  but is recommended highly! :)
