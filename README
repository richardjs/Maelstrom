#Maelstrom#

Maelstrom was originally a classic Mac OS game, first released as shareware in
1992 by Andrew Welch of Ambrosia Software. Ambrosia gave the source to Sam
Lantinga, who released Maelstrom 3.0, a SDL port under the GPL, in 1995. The
game assets were released under the CC Attribution license in 2010.

The latest version of the unmodified SDL port is available at
[http://www.libsdl.org/projects/Maelstrom/](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/Maelstrom/).

This repo is a fork off of the SDL port. There are two primary changes:

1.	The code has been updated to compile on modern machines.

2.	The retro-thrusters powerup has been modified. Instead of being
	constantly active, and thus constantly slowing your ship, they are
	bound to a key, and only activate when that key is pressed.

                          Maelstrom 3.0

Maelstrom 3.0 is a GPL'd port of the original shareware game for the
Macintosh.  It is a fast-action, high resolution (640x480) asteroids-like
game, with detailed graphics and original sounds.

The GPL version of Maelstrom is not supported by Ambrosia Software,
but is recommended highly! :)
